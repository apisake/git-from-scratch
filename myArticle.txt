I've been running away from learning git for a long time.
I suppose to know about git and using it in, like, every day. 
However, that's never happended.
Daniel Shiffman makes me move on to eventually learn git.
He is great. He has a lot of good stuf on his YouTube channel.
He made a series of Git and GitHub on his channel.
