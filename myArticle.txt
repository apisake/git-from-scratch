I've been running away from learning git for a long time.
I suppose to know about git and using it in, like, every day. 
However, that's never happended.
Daniel Shiffman makes me move on to eventually learn git.
He is great. He has a lot of good stuf on his YouTube channel.
He made a series of Git and GitHub on his channel.
The first episodfe he introduced Git and GitHub.
He is good at explaining things. 
Creating a text file on the git project is what he did for the first time.
Then, he committed the file as he wrote several lines of words he about to make it as a poem.
So, I commit and commit to make it worth to see in the graph.
